        <p class="about-description">
            The D.Tech Problem of the Day Challenge (d.PotD) is an online math competition designed for middle school students across the United States. Over the course of five days, participants receive three carefully curated problems each day, covering a diverse range of mathematical topics including algebra, geometry, number theory, probability, and combinatorics. Each day's set includes one proof-based question to encourage mathematical reasoning and communication skills.
        </p>
        <p class="about-description">
            Students have a two-hour window each day to solve the problems and submit their solutions through our online portal. This format allows for flexible participation while maintaining the challenge of timed problem-solving. The competition serves as an excellent preparation for our main event, DTMT, and helps students develop their mathematical intuition, proof-writing abilities, and creative problem-solving approaches.
        </p>
        <p class="about-description">
            Winners will receive prizes and recognition at the D.Tech Math Tournament (DTMT). This event is completely free to participate in and accessible to all middle school students nationwide.
